🩸 Haemo-Agent (Blood Tracker)
​Built for the GDG Buildathon @ COOU

​🌍 The Problem
​In hospitals like COOU Teaching Hospital, finding the right blood donor in an emergency is a race against time. Often, coordination is manual, leading to delays and medical errors—specifically, contacting donors who have donated too recently to give again safely.
​
🚀 The Solution
​Haemo-Agent is an AI-powered logistics tool built in the Antigravity Agentic IDE. It doesn't just store names; it actively manages donor eligibility and coordinates emergency responses.

​🧠 Key Features
​Agentic Search: Uses an AI Dispatcher to scan local donor databases by blood type and location.
​Automatic Eligibility Validation: Enforces the 90-day medical safety rule automatically.
​Real-time Reporting: Generates a formatted Dispatch Report (Markdown) for medical teams to act on immediately.
